    <h1>Big Plans for East Austin's ​Plaza Saltillo</h1>
    <h2>Mixed-use real estate development to come to the ten-acre East Austin plot.</h2>
    <p class="byline">By Rachel Rascoe</p>
    <p class="date">April 1, 2016</p>
</div>


<div class="col-sm-8 col-md-6 col-lg-6 center-block">
<p class="body">
    The Capital Metropolitan board of directors approved Endeavor Real Estate’s Plaza Saltillo project, a 10-acre section of East Austin will be developed into a mixed-use, transit-oriented space including new apartments, office space, retail and a public park.
    </p>

<h3>The Present</h3>
<p class="body">
    Capital Metro currently owns the six blocks of land, which lie east of Interstate 35 between East Fourth and East Fifth Streets. Dallas-based Endeavor Real Estate and Columbus Realty will act as the developers for the project.
    </p>

<p class="body">
    Most blocks of the development are currently empty rail yards. The land also encompasses the Plaza Saltillo Rail Station, the small current Plaza Saltillo structure and the Historic Scoot Inn music venue. These structures will be preserved in the new development.
    </p>

<h3>The Future</h3>
<p class="body">    ​
  Capital Metro announced there will be 110,000 square feet of retail and 120,000 square feet of office space with underground parking. About 1.8 acres, enough to cover one and one-thirds football fields, will be public open space featuring community art.
    </p>


<p class="body">
    The new community space will feature approximately 800 apartments, with at least 15 percent being designated as “affordable.” Those apartments will be rented only to individuals or families whose income is at or below 50 percent of the federally calculated median income, and will include some housing reserved for senior citizens.
    </p>

<p class="body">
    In a statement released by Capital Metro, board member Terry Mitchell said: “This is an important milestone in the long history of redeveloping Plaza Saltillo. The community has shared excellent input about Plaza Saltillo over the past two decades that have helped shape the overall vision for the project.”

<h3>Transportation Goals</h3>
<p class="body">
    The rail line tracks at the Plaza Saltillo stop have been relocated to run alongside the development area. Capital Metro announced that one of its goals for the mixed-use space is to increase riders on both the rail line and local bus routes. The construction will not interrupt existing public transportation services.
    </p>

<p class="body">
    “This transit-oriented development in the heart of East Austin will provide important revenue and ridership to our overall operations while meeting important social goals for the surrounding community,” said Capital Metro president Linda S. Watson in a statement.
    </p>

<h3>Endeavor Real Estate Involvement</h3>
<p class="body">
Endeavor Real Estate and Columbus Realty will pay an initial yearly rent of $1.6 million to Capital Metro for the land. Capital Metro Board and City Council member Ann Kitchen told the Austin-American Statesman the rent will increase by 3 percent for each of the first five years and later be based on rent values within the development.
    </p>

<p class="body">
After Endeavor was granted the project in 2014, negotiations lasted almost two years over the old railroad yard between East Fourth and East Fifth streets. Capital Metro officials declined to say which issues had caused negotiations to drag on.

<div class="col-sm-8 col-md-6 col-lg-6 center-block">
<h3>Wage Battles</h3>
<p class="body">
Satisfying concerns from the Worker’s Defense Project, the wage for construction workers on the project was increased from $11.39 to $13.03 per hour. The Capital Metro board will also participate in the selection of a third party on-site monitor to improve worker safety.
</p>

<p class="body">
The Travis County Democratic Party became involved with the development details through the Worker’s Defense Project, which party communications director Joe Deshotel said they rely on for alerts about labor and safety issues affecting Austin families.
</p>

<p class="body">
“We want the history of East Austin be preserved and to help expand opportunities for its long-time residents,” Deshotel said. “The Saltillo project will bring a lot of community benefits like affordable housing, transit access, public green space and the preservation of some historic structures like the Scoot Inn, which is one of my favorite music venues.”

<h3>What It Is Today</h3>
<p class="body">
The present Plaza Saltillo structure, which has its own <a href="http://www.mystatesman.com/entertainment/arts--theater/plaza-apart-take-walk-through-the-short-history-sometimes-controversial-saltillo/7Zf2fobL85zYB0LQ52IHkO/" target="_blank">long history</a> of past business and development efforts, is currently used on Sundays for the Hope Farmers Market.
</p>

<p class="body">
Nancy Palma, a neighborhood resident who helps run the farmers market, said she has mixed feelings about the development and is unsure whether it will have more positive or negative effects on the present community.
</p>

<p class="body">
“The neighborhood is changing, which is good because the value of my property value is going up, but at the same time, I moved here because I liked the way it was two and a half years ago,” Palma said. “One thing I’m worried about is that it’s going to further isolate longtime residents and increase segregation, which is something we want to combat, but it’s harder the more gentrified the neighborhood becomes.”
</p>

<p class="body">
Construction is anticipated to start in early 2017 and will take over two years to complete.
